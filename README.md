### What I learned

I learned about **Native CSS Nesting**, which allows for cleaner and more readable stylesheets without the need for preprocessors like Sass.

I also explored the differences between using the HTML `<table>` element versus using `<div>`s with CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for creating the pricing table.

- **Tables**: Good for semantic tabular data, but can be rigid and harder to style for complex responsive layouts (like transforming rows to columns or hiding specific columns).
- **Divs + CSS**: I chose this approach because it offered much greater flexibility. It allowed me to easily reorder elements using `order` in Flexbox, hide specific columns (like the 'Team' or 'Free' plans) on smaller screens, and adjust widths dynamically with media queries. This was crucial for achieving the desired responsive design where the layout shifts significantly between mobile and desktop views.
